# South City Meshtastic

## Introduction

This project aims to create and deploy a network of self-sufficient Meshtastic nodes across the South Saint Louis area to achieve the following goals:

- Give radio, network, and electronics nerds a fun project to work on
- Provide a free way for the public to communicate that doesnt rely on commercial infrastructure
- Provide a fault-tolerant mesh network that can continue to operate in emergency and disaster situations when commercial infrastructure is offline

To accomplish these goals we will define, build, and deploy weatherproof, self-powered, outdoor hardware nodes to various locations across South Saint Louis to build a network with as large and robust of a coverage area as possible.
