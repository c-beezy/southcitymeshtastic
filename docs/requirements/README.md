## 1. Durability

The node enclosure must be built for outdoor placement.

It should be gasketed, and any holes or penetrations should be sealed by either a tight-fitting cable gland or some other moisture barrier like butyl, caulk, or hot glue.

The enclosure should be able to withstand hail, being covered in snow or ice, getting baked in the sun for several years, and pecked at by birds.

The node must be able to be durably attached to outdoor structures; either with fasteners or adhesives.

The enclosure must discourage curiosity by not appearing threatening or valuable.

## 2. Self-Powered

The node must include the capability to power itself, i.e. a solar panel that provides enough DC power to run the board plus charge a battery.

The battery system must have enough reserve power for at least one week of continuous operation to account for snow load on the panel.

## 3. Remotely Maintainable

The node must be able to be remotely configured.

The node should be able to be upgraded/flashed without touching the enclosure (ie, wirelessly via bluetooth or ethernet).

## 4. Efficient

The complete assembly must be as cheap as possible, ideally under a hundred dollars per installation.

The node components should be chosen to consume as little power as possible, to reduce the size and cost of the power subsystems.

## 5. Performant

Nodes must be designed with good-performing omnidirectional antennas that are mounted in a way that minimizes attenuation.
