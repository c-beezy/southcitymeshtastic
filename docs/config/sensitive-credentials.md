# Credentials / codes

We're not going to be posting PINs or encryption keys for this network to GitHub. When deploying or administering nodes, admins will be given the credentials via alternate secure methods. Be smart about it so the network doesnt get pwnt.

Possible options: shared google drive that requires authenticated access
Group password safe (like Bitwarden or OnePass)
Sending them back and forth via Signal or other end-to-end encrypted messenger.
