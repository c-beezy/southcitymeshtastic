# Wisblock Notes

The battery connector is JST 2.0
The solar connector is JST 1.25

10000mAH battery: <https://www.amazon.com/Battery-10000mAh-Lithium-Rechargeable-Raspberry/dp/B093WS6C66/>

WisBlock Mini Rev E has changed pinouts to eliminate TX1/RX1 and its a pain to expose them: <https://forum.rakwireless.com/t/rak19003-rev-e-updated-schematic-tx-rx-issues/11404> .   Either use the full size wisblock or buy the socketed breakout module if a generic GPS is needed.

## The polarity that the WisBlock expects on the JST plug is opposite from what most batteries ship with. The positive lead must be on the left, neg on the right (with board oriented USB at top)

AdaFruit apparently has batteries with the JST wired correctly.
